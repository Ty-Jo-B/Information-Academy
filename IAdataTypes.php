			<p>
				In this lesson, we will discuss the four data types in Python. First, we should always put comments in our code so that we will know what our program does, and so that if you share your code with others, they will understand what it does. To make a comment, we put a hashtag in front of the message.

				Now we will discuss four different data-types: Strings, Integers, Floats, and Booleans.<br />
				<em>String:</em> Letters, numbers, or words that cannot be altered.<br />
				<em>Integer:</em> A whole number that can be altered by: addition, multiplication, and division. <br />
				<em>Float:</em> A number with a decimal point that can also be altered by: addition, multiplication, and division.
				<em>Boolean:</em> A data-type with two values: True or False.
			</p>

				Strings are always encased in quotes, but integers, floats, and booleans do not go inside of quotes. If you liked this lesson, please recommend us to family and friends.
