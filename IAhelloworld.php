			<p>
				Welcome to your very first Python-Programming lesson! In this lesson, we will talk about how to print words or numbers onto your shell window. Let's get started! First off, whenever we make a program in python, we must use the '.py' extension. We will call this file 'hello-world.py'.

				To print something to the screen, we simply write: print('Enter Message Here'). Any time you want to print words or letters, use quotation mark: we will explain the reason for this later.

				If we want to print numbers to the screen, we will do the same thing, except this time, we wil not use quotation marks: again, we will explain the reason for this later.
